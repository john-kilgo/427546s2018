How To Operate

Enter a score and a radius and press "Apply Settings" to change from the default wheel.

General Information

My submission includes code written by myself, using references for general knowledge, and notices of where I have borrowed or copied from other sources.

The multisided polygon does not work.

The fractal implementation was not started, see note below.

To Impress I Did:
- Allow apply radius to wheel
- Styled my button
- Gave ability to scroll scores using the input parameters on input type
- Improved wheel design by filling in the rim color

Due to time constraints due to heavy workload (approx. 60 hours per week),
I implemented what I could reasonably do of good quality.
Approx. time spent on this assignment: 8 hours.

This is entirely my own work, except as disclosed in 
the documentation and as commented within my work.

I gave help to the following persons:
None
