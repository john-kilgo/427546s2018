Report on Final Project

Week 2:
For Week 2 I implemented the ability for users to rotate the cube themselves.

After some google searching, I found a plugin called OrbitControls from Three JS:
https://threejs.org/docs/#examples/controls/OrbitControls

I also re-wrote my underlying implementation to make it easier to expand for the next installment.

I found a few issues with making the canvas full screen, I found a fix for this by
setting the canvas element to be display:block 
(https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10425310/three-js-full-screen-issue.)

My goal this time changed a bit due to being more ambitious with planning
than what I could complete in the alloted time. My hope is that by improving the layout and controls
of my canvas that with the next installation I can add more opportunities for user input.

Week 1:
For week one I spent time working on getting used to the three.js library.
I implemented a 3D shape with an animation and limited user controls.

I added text and a cube, and I worked to learn more about three.js.

I accomplished requirements (1) and (2) per the assignment email:
- 1 Create and store a 3D object
- 2 Transform an object

The goal for week 2 is to get the user involved with the object and
its position and placement. In week 2 I would also like to make
my canvas change when the screen is resized.
