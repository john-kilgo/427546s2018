Report on Final Project

Week 1:
For week one I spent time working on getting used to the three.js library.
I implemented a 3D shape with an animation and limited user controls.

I added text and a cube, and I worked to learn more about three.js.

I accomplished requirements (1) and (2) per the assignment email:
- 1 Create and store a 3D object
- 2 Transform an object

The goal for week 2 is to get the user involved with the object and
its position and placement. In week 2 I would also like to make
my canvas change when the screen is resized.
